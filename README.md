# Micro Machines
This project was made for the Computer Graphics subject at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.<br />
It is a "clone" from the MicroMachines video game.<br />

## Compilation:
To compile the game, you will need to import the project in Visual Studio and link GLUT in the project settings. This tutorial will help you to link GLUT to the project. [Tutorial](https://goo.gl/AGa4Z0)<br />
You can find GLUT here:  [GLUT](https://goo.gl/Nlixig)

## Textures:
To properly run the game with its textures, you will need to copy the Resources directory's content to the executable path.<br />
For more information, please read the Resources directory's [README.md](https://github.com/xxlxpto/micro-machines-cg/blob/master/Resources/README.md).
